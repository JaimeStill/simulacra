# Simulacra
See: [Simulacra and Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation).

Study of [**The Nature of Code**](https://natureofcode.com/) by [Daniel Shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

This project is organized around the following constructs:

- [**`simulation`**](./src/app/simulations/) - a self-contained [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/) sample; encapsulates a discrete computational model that explores how fundamental principles manifest into a controlled environment.
- [**`axiom`**](./src/app/axioms/) - fundamental principles upon which different simulations are built; used to categorize **`simulations`**.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
