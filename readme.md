Study of [**The Nature of Code**](https://natureofcode.com/) by [Daniel Shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

This project is organized around the following constructs:

- **`simulation`** - a self-contained [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/) sample; encapsulates a discrete computational model that explores how fundamental principles manifest into a controlled environment.
- **`axiom`** - fundamental principles upon which different simulations are built; used to categorize **`simulations`**.
